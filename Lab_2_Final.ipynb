It could have been 300 ounces or 101 or 250... you just don't know.\n",

    "What is worth with CCD's, and has no analogy to buckets of water, is that after a number of counts (about 60,000 for the 0.4 meter SBIG cameras) they go *nonlinear*. Meaning it might take 1000 photons to elevate a pixel's counts from 50,000 to 60,000, but then it might take 1500 photons to elevate the counts from 60,000 to 70,000.

    "To reduce the number of counts, you can reduce the exposure time. The minimum observation time is 1 second. The shutter on the camera cannot open nor close much faster. There is a way to avoid saturation without reducing observation time. This is achieved by defocusing the telescope. Defocusing the telescope spreads the light out into a donut, making it cast further over the chip. One can do this with the \"Defocus\" parameter when you are scheduling an observation. A decent value is 0.2 or 0.3 mm.\n",
    "\n",

Note that in your observation request, you can select the maximum airmass you want to observe through. Exactly at zenith (right overhead) corresponds to an air mass of 1. Typical observations restrict your request to a cone with an opening angle of 104 degrees -- or 52 degrees off the horizon. This is an airmass of 1.6.

Another 10 minute block 4 hours later, and so forth. Then schedule a few of these blocks during the minimum of the transit. I'm going to call this method \"sparse sampling\" of the transit. However, as you found above, do not schedule single observations. Overhead will quickly eat up your telescope time.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Shorter orbital periods help, because the transits are faster. Algol is not visible currently from any LCO telescopes. It is too close to the sun. However, if you wanted to observe a star like Algol, that just has a few hour transit, then you could do sparse sampling like above. OR you could coordinate with another group and pool your time. With two groups, you could just schedule a single 3 hour block (or two consecutive 1.5 hour blocks) that cover the entire transit of an Algol-like star. That would produce a beautiful data set!\n",

E.g., use the general catalog of variable stars on vizier, and restrict RA to be less than 4 hours and greater than 10 hours -- this will give you everything that is NOT behind the sun. These sources are most likely visible from one of LCO's many observation sites.\n",
